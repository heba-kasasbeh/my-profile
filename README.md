## 📝 Task 4: Basic Linux Navigation

**Objective:** Practice terminal commands.

### ✅ What I did:
- Created a directory named `my_workspace` using `mkdir`.
- Navigated into it using `cd`.
- Created three text files:
  - `intro.txt`
  - `commands.txt`
  - `notes.txt`
- Added 5 commands I learned to `commands.txt`:
  - `pwd` – prints the current working directory
  - `ls` – lists files and directories
  - `cd` – changes the current directory
  - `mkdir` – creates a new folder
  - `rm` – removes files

I also used `cat` to view file contents and verify the files were correctly created.

> 💡 This task helped me practice navigating the file system and working with files directly from the terminal.
